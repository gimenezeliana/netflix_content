# netflix_content

I downloaded a Netflix's dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows

The goal was to explore Netflix's content:

- I've searched the directors with more content
- Analyze where does the content come from
- See the quantity of movies and tv shows by decade
- Check the rating of the content and the release year
- See what are the words most used in titles and genres
- And the people with more appearances casted in movies and tv shows

If you have any advice on how I can improve my analysis, please let me know!
